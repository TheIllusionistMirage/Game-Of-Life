A C++ implementation of the famous Conay's Game of Life (http://en.wi
kipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). Special thanks to texus(http
://github.com/texus) as usual for his infinite patience.
 
To compile the terminal version (without graphics), just compile as it
is. Or if you want graphics, then add the preprocessor definition 
RENDERER_SFML and you can compile the graphical version if you have
SFML installed on your machine.

Feel free to use this wherever you want.
